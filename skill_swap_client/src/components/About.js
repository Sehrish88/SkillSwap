It was designed to connect individuals with others who will help them grow and in turn, reduce the skills gap that we see in society today.   We aim for inclusivity and to make it easier for people to gain access to resources to which money may be a barrier in certain instances. Skill Swapâ€™s main goal is to help people feel empowered, connected, and live life with a sense of purpose while helping societies become more functional.  </h4>
